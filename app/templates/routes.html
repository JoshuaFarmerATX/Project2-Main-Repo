    <p class="myP">
        Many of our API routes utilize dates or ISO3 codes. The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. (Example: 2020-03-15) ISO3 codes are 3 character country codes used for each country. For a list of ISO3 (alpha3 code) codes click <a href="https://www.iban.com/country-codes">here.</a>
        Anywhere "iso3" or "date" are mentioned in a URL, simply replace that with the appropriate date or ISO3 code.
