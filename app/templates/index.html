                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness
                that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes
                COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during
                an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China.
            </p>

                The virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an
                animal source, but is now spreading from person to person.
                The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who
                are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)
                through respiratory droplets produced when an infected
                person coughs or sneezes. It also may be possible that a person
                can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
                the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main
                way the virus spreads.
